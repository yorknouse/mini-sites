                        <p>Ask yourself; what does your academic officer do? What do any of these sabbs do for that matter, why do we pay students to spend a year, full time, working for us? It certainly isn&#8217;t for the events, for their business acumen or giving advice to students; that is better done by professionals. Nor should it be as a spokesperson for the Uni, bigging them up for delivering on past promises. I think representatives are here to do just that, represent. So what are the big issues in your academic life that we, your reps, should be talking about? What are we doing about them? If you can&#8217;t answer these questions then somewhere we&#8217;ve got something wrong; talking about your academic issues is our job.</p>
<p>As Social Sciences faculty rep I know some of these issues. Some students don&#8217;t feel their departments even listen to them, many of us would prefer good quality feedback on our work to a lightning fast turnaround and we&#8217;re all asking what happens when we graduate, even students on masters and PhDs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tried the new employability tutorial you&#8217;ve probably found it too lengthy, hes east can (still) feel like the &#8216;other&#8217; campus and sometimes it just doesn&#8217;t feel like the Uni is listening.</p>
<p>I believe that I&#8217;ve got good answers to these questions; evaluation of marker&#8217;s feedback on assessments, more support for students when we&#8217;ve left Uni and I&#8217;ve argued long and hard with the Uni to strengthen the course rep structure and create more accountability for our departments. I want to put academic issues on the top of the agenda but it&#8217;s not just what I think that matters. Your suggestions, solutions and feedback will inform how we find the answers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to drag you through the entire policy list, but if you do want to see more of my ideas of how we can improve your academic life at York, then check out my Facebook for the details. Even better, drop me an email (erl504) and tell me what you think I should be campaigning on, what you think the biggest issues are. Because fundamentally that is what matters.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got strong ideas and a track record of successes in the roles I&#8217;ve taken on; as faculty coordinator, senate rep and a leading rep in the social sciences department, but that isn&#8217;t why you should vote for me.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll vote for me because my promise to you is that, if you elect me, I&#8217;ll represent you. Every week I&#8217;ll spend at least a full day just getting out there and talking to you about what&#8217;s going on and how we should deal with it. And I promise that next year, when you ask yourself what is it that your academic officer&#8217;s doing, you won&#8217;t just know what it is; you&#8217;ll be the one who told me to do it.</p>

<p>Only 38% of us feel that you are a part of our students&#8217; union. I want to ensure that every student at York knows that a) they are part of our union b) that our union offers them the chance to participate in and create a diverse range of student activities and c) that they are able to comment, complain and compliment the union on the actions they take.</p>
<p>Almost 70% of us are involved in a society in some way. I want to ensure that everyone at York feels that a) our extra-curricular needs and desires are being met with enthusiasm, efficiency and originality b) that our participation is valued, not just by our peers, our committees and our friends, but by YUSU and c) that student involvement is accredited and recognised in a professional context.</p>
<p>SUPPORTING YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS</p>
<p>- Hold regular meetings with the RAG, Volunteering and Group Representatives from Societies Committee to keep in the know.<br />
- Make it clear how our union can help every society. Create an atmosphere we are part of and proud of.<br />
- Only 20% of students were involved in some way in RAG fundraising. I will double this.<br />
- I will find a sponsor for YUSU Volunteering so we can take part in any project we want.</p>
<p>REWARDING YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS</p>
<p>- 35% of students involved in societies hold a committee position or are involved in running the society.<br />
- Create a &#8220;colours&#8221; scheme to recognise this involvement and celebrate our achievements.<br />
- Help our students turn student activities into better job prospects</p>
<p>PROMOTING YOUR ACHIEVEMENTS</p>
<p>- A Student Activities brand which encompasses societies, RAG and volunteering.<br />
- Create and update an Activity Blog, which will feature five new societies every week, with information about what they are about, and how to get involved.<br />
- Increase the ways you can join societies or activities; not just through YUSU Fair.<br />
- A website where students can find and do everything they need within Student Activities.<br />
- Create a self-run international sports volunteering scheme. Allow our students to travel across world, doing whatever sports or activities we want, with whoever we want.</p>
<p>WHY ME?</p>
<p>- YUSU Volunteering Officer (2010-present)<br />

                        <p>My name is Chris West and I believe that you cannot have a true university experience unless you take advantage of what&#8217;s on outside the lecture hall. I know from my experience as treasurer of History Society and the Darts Society what a rewarding experience being involved in a society can offer. I want to run for this position to widen this experience, so everyone can benefit from what York has to offer.</p>
<p>I aim to achieve these goals with a few simple but effective policies &#8211; activities for all, supporting students for all and bigger and better RAG.</p>
<p>Activities for all</p>
<p>My key pledge is to ensure that by the next Freshers&#8217; Fair, every single Fresher is given a voucher to subsidise society membership up to £5.</p>
<p>I will also help develop sponsorship support by building up relations with local businesses, making it easier for societies and media outlets to get funds. This is crucial to the growth of societies, and I will take responsibility for spearheading the policy.</p>
<p>I will be clear to the university &#8211; postering must return. It is the lifeblood of societies and builds a community for students.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to see improved activities training with media training to help activities raise their profile through increased publicity. I will also set up weekly drop-in sessions where I set aside a designated time for anyone to come and ask questions.</p>
<p>Supporting Student Enterprise</p>
<p>In this tough climate, starting and running your own company can not only be a fantastic opportunity, but also make you stand out to potential employers. This is somewhere the union can offer real support, providing workshops to help people turn their ideas into realities and promoting company events</p>
<p>I also believe that student enterprise should be able to access Freshers&#8217; Fair free of charge, in order to showcase the opportunities there are in York for entrepreneurship as well as giving student companies access to all YUSU training.</p>
<p>Bigger and better RAG</p>
<p>I believe RAG can become bigger and better than the already strong position it is in. It needs to become more accessible, so that it is not just the committee and few select others who are running all RAG events.</p>
<p>The termly campus RAG events, such as RAG Week and Winter Wonderland need to be promoted more so they can reach the notoriety of Woodstock. To do this, I will promote links between societies, student media and RAG. I am also keen to ensure that RAG is included in all work done on increasing sponsorship.</p>
<p>I will ensure that RAG Charities have closer connections with RAG, allowing us to organise trips and speakers, so people know where their donations are being spent.</p>
<p>I hope these policies show my commitment to this role, and that I can provide a breath of fresh air into the student activities area. If you want to see these policies in action VOTE CHRIS WEST FOR STUDENT ACTIVITIES!</p>

        <div id="cat1_box_53714" class="tab-box active">
                        <p>From a corset-wearing villain with Pantsoc in Central Hall, to broadcasting with URY, playing the trumpet with Concert Band and fighting it out in Doxbridge and Roses, my life at York has gone way beyond doing my degree &#8211; something I believe to be an essential part in making the most out of your time at university, and a passion for which encouraged me to become involved with YUSU as Student Development Assembly Chair, and run for Student Activities Officer.</p>
<p>So, what do I stand for? The five big policies:</p>
<p>1. Activities on Heslington East &#8211; Allowing societies, RAG and volunteering access to the new campus; be it using the rooms, or sessions with the equipment. With several departments, two colleges and the sports centre set for residence in 2012/13, I believe reaching out to be an achievable and understandable demand.</p>
<p>2. YUSU &#8216;Pot of Gold&#8217; &#8211; I want to make new fund available where Grant and Alumni applications have past or been unsuccessful so that every awesome, yet unexpected, idea can be made a reality. The increase in tuition fees should improve all aspects of the university, and the Union is no exception. This could work in cooperation with YorkSport.</p>
<p>3. The future &#8211; Working with York Alumni is an untapped resource for applying and communicating the advantages of being involved in student activities. I will work with the Alumni Office and Careers Service to tailor speakers and guests to engage with the kinds of activities we offer to give students a face-to-face link with future career paths.</p>
<p>4. Face time &#8211; I will have a dedicated weekly Student Surgery, where anyone &#8211; from societies, RAG, volunteering and beyond &#8211; can come along to suggest a great project, thrash out a problem or just have a chat.</p>
<p>5. The experience &#8211; RAG really makes a mark with campus events like Woodstock and the new Winter Wonderland, so let&#8217;s make them bigger and better! With more involvement from all areas of Activities. Bring more owls on campus! And maybe a couple of reindeer&#8230;</p>
<p>Alongside all that, I promise to keep student interests at heart by looking to make ratification, grant applications and handover simpler, push the use of campus bars, improving the reach and awareness of volunteering and continue to develop the strength and effectiveness of Societies Committee and the Student Development Assembly to make a more integrated and effective YUSU.</p>
<p>With these realistic and achievable goals, and more and more students coming to York next year I will put all my energy into encouraging, enabling and enhancing societies, RAG and volunteering. I believe my involvement in a variety of societies from a fresher to committee member, to my position as Student Development Chair has given me the dedication, insight and organisational skills to do this job to the full, and love every second of it.</p>
<p>Vote Marrison for Activities!</p>
<p>Thanks and love, Helen.</p>

                        <p>Hi, I&#8217;m Lewis and I&#8217;m campaigning to be your next Welfare Officer</p>
<p>I want to focus on student empowerment; for all students this is a key area that needs work.</p>
<p>I want to change the way campaigns are run by the union so that they have greater impact.</p>
<p>I believe welfare isn&#8217;t just about reacting to issues, it&#8217;s<br />
• Providing an environment where students can flourish<br />
• Empowering students to obtain any assistance they need<br />
• Giving support to those who need it, when they need it</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Halifax student and I believe my experiences in and out of YUSU Welfare have given me the required expertise to effect this change.<br />
• Volunteered for Nightline as a listener<br />
• Completed almost 900 hours of shifts<br />
• Focused on Support, Training and Publicity (Kevin the Cow)<br />
• Set up Instant Messaging service<br />
• National Nightline Committee Representative for North and North-East Regions<br />
• Liberation and Welfare Assembly Chair</p>
<p>No matter what the situation, socialising with many new students can be hard. Great work has been done by all colleges on events with non-alcoholic focuses but I believe we need to offer something else. As a start I will provide a relaxed social event each night during Freshers&#8217; Week that is free from social pressures. This will evolve into a student-run Befriending Service, allowing volunteers to support their fellow students.</p>
<p>STYCs are also a key part of Freshers&#8217; Week. I want to make sure that the current changes to the STYC system are seen through. I will work with the college welfare teams so that this is achieved.</p>
<p>Another key issue is the roles of the Part-Time Liberation YUSU officers (Disabled Students, LGBT, Racial Equality and Women&#8217;s). I propose<br />
• Training in leadership, listening and teambuilding, allowing officers to lead, support and represent their demographics effectively<br />
• Setting structures so that officers know where to find support and assistance<br />
Before the union does any more campaigns we must look hard at how we go about them.<br />
• This has been promised year after year without change<br />
• Housing, mental and sexual health, alcohol and other issues are too important to be let down by poor publicity<br />
• Current campaigns rely on stale and lazy methods that lead to poor turnout and have little impact<br />
This must change.</p>
<p>We must<br />
• Invest time in research to find the best ways to make a difference<br />
• Make publicity a key component &#8211; not just an afterthought<br />
• Assist students who want to run campaigns themselves, meaning issues affecting students are tackled directly</p>
<p>As a Welfare Officer I will<br />
• Inform students how to overcome issues and show them what rights they have<br />
• Make clear what students shouldn&#8217;t have to put up with<br />
• Encourage student feedback so we know what is affecting the student body<br />
• Work with the Academic Officer to improve pastoral care given by supervisors</p>
<p>Talk to me, I will listen. Vote Lewis for Welfare Officer.</p>

                        <p>Students arriving at York for the first time are greeted with the most valuable resource at YUSU&#8217;s disposal: the college welfare teams. From welfare reps to Provosts to administrators, this will be the first time students experience what YUSU welfare stands for. It is because of this that I believe the college welfare system needs to be developed to be 100% effective, 100% of the time. My experience as Vanbrugh Female Welfare rep has highlighted where YUSU currently lets JCRCs down in terms of introducing first years to York. Welfare reps need to be thoroughly introduced to the services they signpost students to; how are they meant to advise students on which one to use if they&#8217;re not entirely clear on it themselves? We should be working with colleges to ensure that prices of Fresher&#8217;s Week tickets aren&#8217;t so high that they either exclude students from buying them in the first place or leave them worrying about finances within their first week of leaving home.</p>
<p>Second to this is the STYC system. There are huge inconsistencies not only between each college but also within each college from one year to the next. Three Fresher&#8217;s Fortnights at York have given me the experience to recognise the failings of the current system. No one really seems to know exactly what the roles and responsibilities of a STYC are or should be. Because of this I believe there should be the introduction of a standardised selection process and Code of Conduct throughout out all colleges and that all STYCs should receive the same training; the help of current and previous STYCs should be enlisted to help develop this. A common selection and training processes will ensure all STYCs receive effective, relevant training that will be a benefit to them and the students during and after Fresher&#8217;s Week.</p>
<p>However, it isn&#8217;t just Freshers and STYCs who need the support of YUSU&#8217;s welfare system. Every night groups of students head into town whether it is for a few pints at their favourite pub, or one of those nights which results in a Willow stamp. Whichever one it is, you should feel that you are safe. A recent increase in drink spiking should have let to an increase in Alcohol Awareness campaigns, but instead Alcohol Awareness week came and went with very little fuss. I want to work with bars both on and off campus to increase awareness of things like Spikeys and having more affordable non-alcoholic drinks. Alongside this idea of welfare for all are developments that can be made in the areas of health, accommodation and personal safety.</p>
<p>With over 15,000 students and only 5 full time officers we need the support of the JCRCs and their welfare reps to ensure students&#8217; real needs are attended to. It will not be easy but students need to see that the YUSU is catering for them. YUSU needs to regain the faith of its students by listening and responding to them. Wigley for Welfare.</p>

                        <p>Last year, I promised greater focus on mental health, more sexual health screening at the Health Centre and more innovative ways of getting information to you. I brought you a series of events on emotional wellbeing and progress towards better mitigating circumstances procedure for when things go wrong. I brought you extra GUM clinic sessions in the Health Centre. And I brought you new ideas, from the hugely successful Clubbers&#8217; Bus to get you home safely from a night out, to working with YSTV on York Come Dine With Me. But there is still a lot to be done.</p>
<p>This year will see massive changes to our University: the introduction of the 24-hour library, Langwith&#8217;s move to Heslington East, and the introduction of £9k fees. At this time of flux, it&#8217;s vital that we have a Welfare Officer who has already hit the ground running to ensure you get the support you need, from support services, late-night food-making facilities in the library and security to help you get home safely, to making sure that Heslington West, Fairfax and Halifax aren&#8217;t forgotten when it comes to investment in safety, security and lighting.</p>
<p>The quality of campus accommodation varies wildly; for students left with the last choice of where to live, it&#8217;s unfair that you are being given cramped kitchens, faulty facilities and a reporting structure that often leaves you waiting weeks for repairs. I have been vocal about this with the University, pushed for development of older accommodation, and organised consultation meetings where you can speak directly to the people who oversee your accommodation and have your views heard. I want to see this expand and become a regular part of how decisions affecting you are made: involving you.</p>
<p>With rising rents, we need a Welfare Officer who can hold landlords accountable to University standards, using the results of upcoming research to challenge bad practice across the board, and stop you getting messed around by letting you know your rights as tenants. I will bring in measures for properties to be checked so that you know that your landlord is providing you with the best accommodation they can and put information out early so that you are as well-informed about housing as possible well before you sign.</p>
<p>Pressure on students under the new fee regime will be greater than ever before- we need support services that meet demand, reflect need and are accessible at all levels. I will lobby for extra, more relevant training for supervisors, push for more support staff across the University, and work with departments so they understand the importance of mitigating circumstances- you shouldn&#8217;t be disadvantaged because of which degree you chose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve proven that I can deliver results for you, and this year, I&#8217;m more passionate, experienced and energetic than ever. So please re-elect me, Bob Hughes, as your Welfare Officer.</p>

Focusing on performance, participation and communication I want to make York Sport the strongest it has ever been.</p>
<p>Performance- It is essential that our students optimise their personal potential through these facilities. The new sports center, a clear equal of David Lloyd has the tools to allow the advancement of individuals in an array of sports. I want to ensure that our students are being given the best opportunities to harness their talents and excel.</p>
<p>Participation- Both university sport and college sport has to be driven from fresher&#8217;s week. In particular I want to improve the infrastructure of college sport, extending some leagues as well as looking at other sports which could be introduced. I also want to continue to establish links between college sports and their university equivalents, looking at creating more barbarian teams as this is beneficial both for university teams who can look for potential new talent and for college teams who can gain experience and coaching.</p>
<p>Communication- I propose the introduction of a termly meeting with Presidents of clubs with the York Sport Committee as well as creating a group which includes all of these members to ensure that clubs feel fully aware of the changes and happenings within York Sport. Moreover, closer cooperation between club presidents will help to foster a sense of unity between clubs enable the clubs to share ideas, such as the best methods to promote or fundraiser for their club. I feel it will also generate a greater level of support between clubs, we need more people coming down to 22 acres and the sports tent to support our teams. York shouldn&#8217;t be about individual teams it should be one team.</p>
<p>Having competed both at college and university level sport since my first year, and being College Sport Officer and a member of the York Sport Committee, I have a thorough understanding of how sport is administered and perceived at York. Moreover, through these experiences I have developed a passion for not only sport, but York Sport wanting to make it the best it can be.</p>

                        <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a final year Accounting student, running for York Sport President and I aim to bring my skills and abilities to York Sport, continuing the successes from Sam Asfahani. The last two years have seen huge progress within Sport at York. I promise to continue this achievement, adapting to new changes being implemented, most notably the Sports Village and the students fee increase.</p>
<p>I am a University and college hockey player, a qualified hockey umpire, and am already a YUSU employee, working at the Courtyard and also as part of the Doorsafe team. For the last two years I have been part of the Halifax College committee, and was a key member in setting up the Accounting &#038; Finance Society. With these credentials, I am certain I can bring a refreshed and excellent service to Sport at York.</p>
<p>Sports allow people to develop themselves and one of my main goals is to increase awareness of the sporting clubs and facilities available. Uniting diverse groups of university students will increase individual development, allow greater social activity, and strengthen the standard of York Sport. This will require close work with individual colleges and departments, and both sporting and non-sporting societies; raising significant awareness of what we can provide.</p>
<p>In addition, I aim to form an inter-college communication system and enhance this with a college-university system allowing members of university sports teams to easily communicate with their college counterparts to discuss new potential talent, and offer playing time to those who are missing out.</p>
<p>The New Sports Village will also be debuting in 2012, and I will be ensuring a smooth and seamless transformation. Foreseeing potential transportation and logistical issues will be part of this, especially when transporting kit and players from site to site. I will discuss with York Pullman Buses to investigate a more frequent inter-campus service on a Wednesday to provide greater flexibility to teams. Roses 2013 will also be the first to be played at York with our new Sports Village, and it will be a rewarding success to win and overcome any challenges.</p>
<p>With regards to transportation, I will draw up and issue all teams with clear travel guidelines when playing away. Too often teams have struggled to get to away matches on time or have been left waiting. I will also investigate the provisions of extra transport arrangements such as self-drive minibuses, leading to cost benefits and shorter travelling times.</p>
<p>Finally, the lease on the sports tent is only valid for four years, and one of my long term legacies will be to investigate the viable options of extending its life. I will also be providing the groundwork and investigating the possibility of modernising the life of the current facilities, particularly the athletics track. Whilst the new Sports Village is set to dominate, keeping our current facilities up to date showcases the excellence of York Sport and will draw in many key talents in the future.</p>
<p>So vote for Dong-Oh as your York Sport President.</p>

            <img src="eppie-leishman.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>Ask yourself; what does your academic officer do? What do any of these sabbs do for that matter, why do we pay students to spend a year, full time, working for us? It certainly isn&#8217;t for the events, for their business acumen or giving advice to students; that is better done by professionals. Nor should it be as a spokesperson for the Uni, bigging them up for delivering on past promises. I think representatives are here to do just that, represent. So what are the big issues in your academic life that we, your reps, should be talking about? What are we doing about them? If you can&#8217;t answer these questions then somewhere we&#8217;ve got something wrong; talking about your academic issues is our job.</p>
<p>As Social Sciences faculty rep I know some of these issues. Some students don&#8217;t feel their departments even listen to them, many of us would prefer good quality feedback on our work to a lightning fast turnaround and we&#8217;re all asking what happens when we graduate, even students on masters and PhDs.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tried the new employability tutorial you&#8217;ve probably found it too lengthy, hes east can (still) feel like the &#8216;other&#8217; campus and sometimes it just doesn&#8217;t feel like the Uni is listening.</p>
<p>I believe that I&#8217;ve got good answers to these questions; evaluation of marker&#8217;s feedback on assessments, more support for students when we&#8217;ve left Uni and I&#8217;ve argued long and hard with the Uni to strengthen the course rep structure and create more accountability for our departments. I want to put academic issues on the top of the agenda but it&#8217;s not just what I think that matters. Your suggestions, solutions and feedback will inform how we find the answers.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not going to drag you through the entire policy list, but if you do want to see more of my ideas of how we can improve your academic life at York, then check out my Facebook for the details. Even better, drop me an email (erl504) and tell me what you think I should be campaigning on, what you think the biggest issues are. Because fundamentally that is what matters.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got strong ideas and a track record of successes in the roles I&#8217;ve taken on; as faculty coordinator, senate rep and a leading rep in the social sciences department, but that isn&#8217;t why you should vote for me.</p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll vote for me because my promise to you is that, if you elect me, I&#8217;ll represent you. Every week I&#8217;ll spend at least a full day just getting out there and talking to you about what&#8217;s going on and how we should deal with it. And I promise that next year, when you ask yourself what is it that your academic officer&#8217;s doing, you won&#8217;t just know what it is; you&#8217;ll be the one who told me to do it.</p>

            <img src="graeme-osvborn.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>This year will see the first students paying £9,000 arrive at York. It is up to us to make sure they get the education they deserve. We must not however let this distract us from fighting for the interest of all our members, regardless of how much they are paying. I believe that I can provide the academic leadership that YUSU needs, and that is why I am standing for re-election as your Academic Officer.</p>
<p>This year I want to deliver 3 key policies:</p>
<p>Electronic submission of assessment:</p>
<p>Electronic submission of assessments will tackle two key issues: solving printer credit costs by reducing the amount students have to print, and preventing students from having to re-submit work if it goes missing from a department once handed in (as happened this year). It also paves the way for online feedback.</p>
<p>Earlier exam timetables:</p>
<p>Students need earlier access to their exam time table for a number of reasons; booking travel to and from university, fitting in part-time jobs and accommodating events which occur during exam periods, from other types of qualifications to sport and society commitments. Currently students are given less than five weeks notice of when their exams will be.</p>
<p>Investment in teaching spaces:</p>
<p>The university desperately needs more investment in its teaching spaces; some of the rooms on Heslington West are an embarrassment to a university with York&#8217;s reputation, and the increasing student numbers will only exacerbate the problems. We need more new, purpose-built teaching spaces designed for the teaching requirements of the 21st century. This will not only improve the learning experience but also improve timetabling.</p>
<p>I am confident that I can achieve these goals as I already have considerable experience fighting for the interests of York students as your Academic Officer. This year I have achieved:</p>
<p>24-hour library</p>
<p>When I took office there was only &#8216;in principle&#8217; agreement for 24-hour opening, with no agreed date. They hadn&#8217;t even worked out how much it would cost to open 24 hours for next year. The library is now going to open 24/7 during summer term, and all year round from September.</p>
<p>Faster feedback</p>
<p>Last year 6 departments failed to meet the university&#8217;s 6-week deadline for feedback. I have spent this year working with individual departments to ensure this deadline is met, for it is only once all departments meet the deadline that we can realistically lobby for it to be shortened. My efforts have so far been successful; only one department has missed the deadline.</p>
<p>Better quality teaching</p>
<p>I have pushed for better quality teaching at every level. My efforts have been rewarded by several hundred thousand pounds being allocated for new teaching staff in departments with poor student-staff ratios and extra training for post-graduates who teach.</p>
<p>I have proven that I can deliver on my promises and the experience of the last year has made me even more passionate, so please re-elect me, Graeme Osborn, as your Academic Officer.</p>

Student Ambassador<br />
 -Zoe was transferred to York from St.Andrews were she was a  committee member of the Biology and V-Day societies.<br />
 -Zoe was also head of the 2010-1 Biology ball committee, which produced the first biology ball for ten years.</p>
<p> -During her involvement with the V-Day society at St Andrews Zoe assisted in the promotion and sale of tickets for the production of the Vagina Monologues; organised fundraising and awareness campaigns/events including themed pub crawls and &#8216;tea and cake chats&#8217; with guest speakers.</p>
<p>Summary of policies:</p>
<p>If elected we would promote and facilitate the creation of meaningful, open conversations about women&#8217;s issues; by all in the community, regardless of gender. To achieve this we would aim to increase student (and staff) awareness of planned events in the hopes of raising attendance.</p>
<p>Effective awareness campaigns should not &#8216;talk at&#8217; people, but engage them. We would aim to combat the negative effects of media perpetuated societal norms; by promoting body positivity and self confidence.</p>
<p>We would seek to widen university participation and appeal to a broader demographic by surveying student opinion. We also feel that fundraising for local and global charities should be an integral part of the role; and have some great ideas about how to raise money whilst educating those taking part.</p>

<p>Involvement with University:<br />
 -Course Rep for the Social Policy Department for two years. </p>
<p>Summary of policies:</p>
<p> -More smoking bins around campus, campus accommodation and campus bus stops. The reason behind this is that cigarette butts unlike other waste tend to lay on campus for a long time effecting the overall appearance of the campus, that the use of the plastic bins to put out cigarettes effects the appearance of those bins/creates a fire hazard and means that people wanting to throw away other waste are subjected to passive smoke.<br />
 -Better lighting on campus, especially around James campus. There is currently no light on the James Bridge which has scaffolding; this is potentially a health and safety concern. Currently there is no lighting between the bridge and the department of mathematics and also between the department of mathematics and the parking lot.<br />
 -To ensure that the all research and investments from the university/ going into the university are ethically sound.<br />
 -To be available for the Environment and Ethics Reps for all the colleges and voice their opinions and concerns to the Community Assembly Committee.<br />
 -To widen and promote the Environment and Ethics Network to as many environmental/ethics organisations and department bodies as possible. </p>

&#8220;Anybody can do anything!&#8221;</p>
<p>MOVEMENT I: NIGHTLINE</p>
<p>Have you ever felt sad during the day? I have. Nightline in its current form actively discriminates against non-nocturnal depressives.</p>
<p>Why not Night AND Day Line (NDL)? NDL, the abbreviated form of the Netherlands (high standard of living) and the acronym for the National Diet Library. Coincidence? No.</p>
<p>Also one of my favourite Cole Porter songs.</p>
<p>I pledge to man the phone lines for every hour otherwise unmanned/womaned by a trained volunteer (probably arts students during the day).</p>
<p>MOVEMENT II: THE LIBRARY</p>
<p>Knowledge is the key to the door of wisdom. Our collective door*is still unhinged.</p>
<p>FINISH IT.</p>
<p>I pledge to lay every brick not laid by someone paid to lay bricks.</p>
<p>* The door I was referring to in this passage is in fact a metaphorical illusion representative of the unfinished JB Morrel library.</p>
<p>MOVEMENT III: TOTAL TRANSPARENCY</p>
<p>I will NOT stand for translucency.</p>
<p>From autumn 2012 tuition fees will rise to £9,000. This is an OUTRAGE. And one we all, myself included, protested about in London. Regrettably, I could only protest in spirit because long coach journeys make me feel nauseous.</p>
<p>We should be told how our money is being spent and whether lectures and seminars are, in fact, teaching or just words. With £9,000 you could buy a Toyota Aygo, 1/3 of a static caravan or 1,286 copies of Anne Frank&#8217;s Diary, the University of York needs to be ruddy bloody good to fall into line with those.</p>
<p>Thus, TOTAL TRANSPARENCY. Tell us what is happening, are you paying silly bonuses? You shouldn&#8217;t be. Bonuses are bad, that much has already been proven. I am not a hypocrite, I can do talk AND walk. I have already (totally unprovoked) started a video diary where for no charge you can watch me tell you how I am and what I&#8217;m doing. Follow my example!</p>
<p>I pledge to continue Vlogging for as long as you continue watching my face.</p>
<p>MOVEMENT IV: GEESE POLICE™</p>
<p>&#8220;A bird doesn&#8217;t sing because it has an answer, it sings because it has a song.&#8221;</p>
<p>Work in progress. It&#8217;s a catchy name so it would be a shame not to give them something to do.</p>
<p>I pledge to cover every Geese Police patrol not patrolled by someone else.</p>
<p>MOVEMENT V: FIVE-YEAR/FIVE POINT PLAN FOR IMPROVING GRADUATE EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>MOVEMENT VI: YUSU CENSORSHIP</p>

If, as I believe, the ends of men are many, York needs a moon base. Because corporations are people too, we must stop class warfare, and thus abolish the union. To the well organised mind death is but the next great adventure, thus health and safety regulations will be abolished. Every challenge along the way with courage I will face. I will battle every day to claim my rightful place. Come with me, the time is right, there&#8217;s no better team. Arm in arm we&#8217;ll win the fight, it&#8217;s always been my dream. My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognises them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.) He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the word rightly. Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent. Restore America now. Abir 2012. The ONE who can beat Obama.</p>

            <img src="nacho-hernando.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>In the last 2 years there has been a significant structural shake-up in YUSU. I am running for President because I believe our Union, through lobbying and delivering practical services, can now focus on the overarching aim of enhancing our students&#8217; EDUCATION, EMPLOYABILITY and student EXPERIENCE.</p>
<p>*Fees, where&#8217;s my change?*</p>
<p>With the introduction of £9000 fees it is vital that we make sure students get value for their money.</p>
<p>As well as campaigning at a national level through the NUS and at the local level by following through the campaign to reduce hidden costs, one of my key practical services would be to see our Union deliver an ACADEMIC MENTORING scheme. By providing more PART-TIME JOBS FOR POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS, often neglected by our Union, this scheme would offer small student ratio (e.g. 3 to 1) LESSONS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS.</p>
<p>Employability of students is the most significant service that our Union and University fail to deliver in. The Guardian&#8217;s University league table ranks York 40th in the &#8216;Career after 6 months&#8217; column. This is unacceptable. We must urgently lobby the University to REVIEW CAREERS SERVICES and coordinate efforts with the Alumni Office.</p>
<p>The University has limited funds dedicated to campus development. We should lobby the University not to neglect the need for further refurbishment of Heslington West before any further development of Heslington East.</p>
<p>*Champion for Colleges*</p>
<p>Colleges are integral.<br />
Colleges find it challenging to organise events that are more varied than the standard nights out. There is pressure from the University to provide alternatives, however, the grants allocated for such events are inadequate. One of my key policies would be to lobby for an INCREASE IN COLLEGE WELFARE GRANTS BY AT LEAST 50%.</p>
<p>I would also install &#8216;HAVE YOUR SAY&#8217; BOXES IN COMMON ROOMS as I believe communication with colleges is essential.</p>
<p>*Switched ON UniON*</p>
<p>As we come to the end of our current Union Strategic Plan, we must begin to think of where to invest next. Around 5 years ago the alternative decision to building the Courtyard was to acquire a venue/club in town. I would like the idea of acquiring a YUSU CLUB to be part of our next 3-year Strategic Plan.</p>
<p>We must also protect students, promote good standards in student housing and make sure that your rights are respected by landlords. Thus, we must lobby the City Council to uphold its LANDLORDS&#8217; CODE OF BEST PRACTICE. We must also protect student areas from the application of discriminatory anti-HMO legislation that has recently been approved.</p>
<p>New Assemblies have been established and YUSU must fuel these with important debates to attract students and show them how they can determine Union outcomes.</p>
<p>We need better training and GREATER RESPONSIBILITIES FOR PART-TIME OFFICERS, who have often been undervalued.</p>
<p>Many of our fellow students are international; we therefore need a better coordinated and college based International Freshers&#8217; Week. After Freshers, greater support in subsequent years for international students searching for private accommodation is needed.</p>

            <img src="zahra-latif.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>YUSU is a union. That means its voice comes from you. But it doesn&#8217;t feel like that does it? I believe YUSU needs to change and that every student should know that YUSU is only strong as those it represents. I am running for president because I believe passionately that YUSU can work better for you and I want to lead that change.</p>
<p>We are entering a new university environment next year. The campus expansion will mean two colleges on Hes East and it will be York&#8217;s 50th anniversary. Students more than ever need to feel invested in their union and that every individual voice counts.</p>
<p>MY POLICIES:</p>
<p>OPEN REPRESENTATION:<br />
What does a sabbatical officer actually do?</p>
<p>So many students not knowing the answer to this question shows that YUSU isn&#8217;t open enough. Although positive changes have been made with the creation of the different assemblies we need to communicate better. We need to get people excited about participating and for the sabbatical officers to be more accessible to you.</p>
<p>I want to introduce weekly officer cookies and milk in various locations across campus on both Hes East and Hes West. Let&#8217;s have open air assemblies on Vanbrugh paradise so that participation is fun and not a chore! Lets have &#8216;be a sabb for a day&#8217; week and increase transparency and make the sabbs more accountable.</p>
<p>STRENGTHENING THE COMMUNITY:<br />
The majority of students live off campus after their first year. As the council pushes legislation that negatively impacts student housing YUSU needs to take a lead and work with the student population to lobby councillors. We need to build stronger bridges that show the community the positive difference students make.</p>
<p>The support of YUSU shouldn&#8217;t stop when you graduate. Students need to feel part of the York community even after they leave. The employment market presents new challenges and having stronger alumnae links will hugely benefit our outgoing students.</p>
<p>SUPORTING YOU BETTER:<br />
Our part-time officers do amazing work in supporting the vast diversity of our students, but empowering them with even greater support means a better experience for all. The careers service has some great resources but YUSU needs to work innovatively to get students involved.</p>
<p>WHO AM I? I&#8217;m a third year studying English literature and History and I&#8217;ve been involved with the Union since my first year. I&#8217;ve been elected course representative and faculty rep winning the &#8216;best newcomer course rep&#8217; and &#8216;course rep of the year&#8217; YUSU awards. I&#8217;ve chaired the English Society and I&#8217;m vice-president of the Islamic Society and I&#8217;ve been elected as one of your delegates to the NUS national conference this year.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve listened to students, I&#8217;ve listened to staff and tutors, and I know how to build effective relationships. It&#8217;s been a privilege working with so many fantastic people and I have discovered a real passion and talent for representing you &#8211; I want to take this further and represent the union as a whole.<br />

<p>Vision? Focus? The students?</p>
<p>With cuts to Higher Education funding and the coming increase in fees, students become a huge revenue stream for the University, which gives us huge power. We need a Union that can stand up for students and fight effectively to reduce fees, eliminate hidden course costs and deliver value for money.</p>
<p>Right now, YUSU isn&#8217;t ready.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s missing the issues that matter: it&#8217;s missing your ideas.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s:<br />
&#8211;Cut off YUSU Officers&#8217; Internet once a week and get them out talking to people they don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>&#8211;Do two really good surveys a year, rather than loads of small and unrepresentative ones, so that we can do research that matters without overconsulting students.</p>
<p>&#8211;Employ novel methods for reaching those we consider &#8216;unreachable&#8217; and giving a voice to the unvoiced, such as exploring online consultation for distance learners and developing a Photovoice project with Disabled Students&#8217; Network for those who lack verbal fluency due to a physical or social difficulty.</p>
<p>&#8211;Target groups and departments we know YUSU doesn&#8217;t reach such as Health Sciences, HYMS, Social Work students and the Centre for Medieval Studies.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t just want to make our Union listen to you: I want to make it listen to every student.</p>
<p>&#8212;-Let&#8217;s think bigger&#8212;-<br />
If we can get YUSU caught up in the next year, then we can ready the Union to do something really exciting in the years that follow. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m making a promise to work hard to prepare the Union to deliver a truly special experience:</p>
<p>&#8211;Let&#8217;s bring student satisfaction above 50%<br />
Right now, only 45% of York students think that YUSU is having a positive impact. I promise that come 2013, that number will be at least 50%, but that&#8217;s not enough: I promise that it won&#8217;t drop below 40% in any department. This is a tough target, but we deserve a Union that works hard for us, and I will make YUSU work hard for us.</p>
<p>&#8212;-But why just make it count, when we can make it extraordinary?&#8212;-<br />
We have one year to get the Union up to speed and meet the goals it&#8217;s set itself, but we need to look to the future. YUSU&#8217;s current plan is to build a Union that actually makes a difference to students&#8217; lives and represents us when we really need it. I want to build a Union that does that and more. York is an exciting place to live and an exciting place to study; let&#8217;s build a Union that&#8217;s exciting, that runs exciting events, provides exciting spaces, puts on exciting and effective protests, and protects colleges.</p>
<p>With the right people and the right plans, we can build a better Union, a better University and a better time at York for everyone. If you elect me, I won&#8217;t just make it count: I&#8217;ll make it extraordinary.</p>
<p>&#8212;-Let&#8217;s get ambitious&#8212;-</p>

<p>When I say I want to improve York University for the students, I mean it. </p>
<p>My time as a College Chair saw a £100,000 bar re-furb, the integration of an additional 100 students, record STYC numbers and sponsorship, and defeating rent increases.  I loved this, despite the ups and downs, and want to do the same with YUSU.</p>
<p>Being &#8216;involved&#8217; with JCRC affairs, sports and societies has been incredibly rewarding, and I&#8217;m aware of why certain things work a certain way. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m satisfied with the line YUSU takes on a lot of issues. YUSU needs to be sterner, and less ashamed of fighting our corner, the student&#8217;s corner.</p>
<p>This next year is a massive one for our University.</p>
<p>There are 14,000 of us and counting. This should be a matter of urgency for YUSU, who need to get back in touch with you.</p>
<p>An entire college is moving over to an ever-developing HES EAST, we&#8217;ve got the first set of £9000 freshers coming in and, of course, it&#8217;s our 50th BIRTHDAY too.</p>
<p>Those 3 points alone demand that the union NEEDS to be &#8211; and should WANT to be &#8211; seen, heard, and delivering for us so much more on issues long and short term.</p>
<p>For years now York has been one of those &#8216;nearly there&#8217; universities &#8211; in light of the above events though, it&#8217;s time that we make this a UNIVERSITY TO BE PROUD OF.</p>
<p>If you VOTE KALLUM FOR PRESIDENT, then YUSU will be pro-active &#8211; not reactive &#8211; in increasing value for money and employability, making Hes East and West fit for their PEOPLE and PURPOSE, improving campus events and doing better for off-campus students.</p>
<p>YUSU should be visible and transparent.</p>
<p>50% of our students don&#8217;t actually realise they&#8217;re part of YUSU, and some of those who do, don&#8217;t know what it does. This is such a waste of potential both for the union, and students together.</p>
<p>Officers should be out of the office more when possible, having weekly surgeries on both campuses and posting regular blogs on our work. I want you to see us justify our salaries.</p>
<p>If you VOTE KALLUM TAYLOR FOR PRESIDENT, YUSU won&#8217;t look USELESS.</p>
<p>A Kallum Taylor Presidency will make sure that we ARE a catalyst for change and we DO get the improvements we deserve&#8230;</p>
<p>Serious matters aside now; I also want us to work out a week of events, to celebrate YORK&#8217;S 50th BIRTHDAY, culminating in WOODSTOCK 2013. Watch this space! </p>
<p>I would love it if you wanted to hear more. If so, hit me up on Facebook!</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;ll discuss all of my policies; such as kitchens for off-campus students, more cycle storage, a catering space on HES EAST and the introduction of some quality Student Union nights!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read this, then thank you, and please do SHOW YORK THE WAY, AND VOTE SPECIAL K!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Kallum, X (kt573)</p>

<p>You promise us all and give us nothing<br />
your incredulous audacity exhausts me.</p>
<p>What have you given me?<br />
Three VKs for five pounds,<br />
two pockets full of rain and a shattered mind.</p>
<p>Who are you, YUSU?<br />
When will you be worthy of your thousand trailblazers?</p>
<p>Why does your commercial arm have no democratically elected representative?<br />
A cynic would call you greedy. I&#8217;m an honourable cynic.</p>
<p>Go f*** yourself with your bureaucracy.<br />
I don&#8217;t like politics, it&#8217;s showbiz for the ugly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s our existence that defines you,<br />
not the converse. And our existence<br />
precedes our essence; yours does not.</p>
<p>The media charter is censorship hidden under welfare. People are good at heart.</p>
<p>You are a business and we are your paying customers;<br />
the customer is always right.</p>
<p>We are not cogs in the machinery of money.</p>
<p>I sit in my room for days on end and stare at Facebook.<br />
I&#8217;m sick of hypocrisy.<br />
I&#8217;m tired of you putting the wrong into my rights.<br />
It&#8217;s all an illusion, you know;<br />
autocratic democracy imposed from up high.</p>
<p>The future frightens me,<br />
as does our lack of volunteer work<br />
and confused moral philosophy.</p>
<p>When I dream<br />
I have and radical intentions;<br />
microcosmic migranes.</p>
<p>My mind is filled with empty thoughts.</p>
<p>President, we don&#8217;t pay for you to write a blog and give the odd quote to campus media.</p>
<p>My ambition is to be President, despite not being a liar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of being approached by<br />
spineless statues, college chairs in backdoor meetings union fixtures prostituting empty rhetoric.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t make promises like them;<br />
promises break before they&#8217;re made.</p>
<p>When will you ask me what I want?</p>
<p>What do I want? I want more parking spaces<br />
I want more for my fees; I want a real collegiate system; I want better healthcare.</p>
<p>Being a student isn&#8217;t just about studying.<br />
And what if I were international or post graduate in Wentworth?<br />
The world forgetting by the world forgot?<br />
I want activism. I want us to lead.<br />
We are the them of tomorrow, don&#8217;t you know?</p>
<p>YUSU, I want to be heard!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m bored of your smiles and bastardisation;<br />
your blatant pontification.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sick of our so called representatives sucking<br />
the metaphorical d***s of big wigs.<br />
Big wigs are serious. They like big profits, holidays and chalets.<br />
I want to stand up, not bend over. These great minds built Heslington East out of wood. Who would?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a joke. I just don&#8217;t want to make a dozen broken promises in the form of a manifesto. YUSU is not an extended arm of Heslington Hall. I want to be the representative of a united student body. Together, we will have a voice and we will be heard. We should run the University; the University should not run us.</p>

            <img src="hannah-wigley.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>Students arriving at York for the first time are greeted with the most valuable resource at YUSU&#8217;s disposal: the college welfare teams. From welfare reps to Provosts to administrators, this will be the first time students experience what YUSU welfare stands for. It is because of this that I believe the college welfare system needs to be developed to be 100% effective, 100% of the time. My experience as Vanbrugh Female Welfare rep has highlighted where YUSU currently lets JCRCs down in terms of introducing first years to York. Welfare reps need to be thoroughly introduced to the services they signpost students to; how are they meant to advise students on which one to use if they&#8217;re not entirely clear on it themselves? We should be working with colleges to ensure that prices of Fresher&#8217;s Week tickets aren&#8217;t so high that they either exclude students from buying them in the first place or leave them worrying about finances within their first week of leaving home.</p>
<p>Second to this is the STYC system. There are huge inconsistencies not only between each college but also within each college from one year to the next. Three Fresher&#8217;s Fortnights at York have given me the experience to recognise the failings of the current system. No one really seems to know exactly what the roles and responsibilities of a STYC are or should be. Because of this I believe there should be the introduction of a standardised selection process and Code of Conduct throughout out all colleges and that all STYCs should receive the same training; the help of current and previous STYCs should be enlisted to help develop this. A common selection and training processes will ensure all STYCs receive effective, relevant training that will be a benefit to them and the students during and after Fresher&#8217;s Week.</p>
<p>However, it isn&#8217;t just Freshers and STYCs who need the support of YUSU&#8217;s welfare system. Every night groups of students head into town whether it is for a few pints at their favourite pub, or one of those nights which results in a Willow stamp. Whichever one it is, you should feel that you are safe. A recent increase in drink spiking should have let to an increase in Alcohol Awareness campaigns, but instead Alcohol Awareness week came and went with very little fuss. I want to work with bars both on and off campus to increase awareness of things like Spikeys and having more affordable non-alcoholic drinks. Alongside this idea of welfare for all are developments that can be made in the areas of health, accommodation and personal safety.</p>
<p>With over 15,000 students and only 5 full time officers we need the support of the JCRCs and their welfare reps to ensure students&#8217; real needs are attended to. It will not be easy but students need to see that the YUSU is catering for them. YUSU needs to regain the faith of its students by listening and responding to them. Wigley for Welfare.</p>

            <img src="lewis-haines.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>Hi, I&#8217;m Lewis and I&#8217;m campaigning to be your next Welfare Officer</p>
<p>I want to focus on student empowerment; for all students this is a key area that needs work.</p>
<p>I want to change the way campaigns are run by the union so that they have greater impact.</p>
<p>I believe welfare isn&#8217;t just about reacting to issues, it&#8217;s<br />
• Providing an environment where students can flourish<br />
• Empowering students to obtain any assistance they need<br />
• Giving support to those who need it, when they need it</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a Halifax student and I believe my experiences in and out of YUSU Welfare have given me the required expertise to effect this change.<br />
• Volunteered for Nightline as a listener<br />
• Completed almost 900 hours of shifts<br />
• Focused on Support, Training and Publicity (Kevin the Cow)<br />
• Set up Instant Messaging service<br />
• National Nightline Committee Representative for North and North-East Regions<br />
• Liberation and Welfare Assembly Chair</p>
<p>No matter what the situation, socialising with many new students can be hard. Great work has been done by all colleges on events with non-alcoholic focuses but I believe we need to offer something else. As a start I will provide a relaxed social event each night during Freshers&#8217; Week that is free from social pressures. This will evolve into a student-run Befriending Service, allowing volunteers to support their fellow students.</p>
<p>STYCs are also a key part of Freshers&#8217; Week. I want to make sure that the current changes to the STYC system are seen through. I will work with the college welfare teams so that this is achieved.</p>
<p>Another key issue is the roles of the Part-Time Liberation YUSU officers (Disabled Students, LGBT, Racial Equality and Women&#8217;s). I propose<br />
• Training in leadership, listening and teambuilding, allowing officers to lead, support and represent their demographics effectively<br />
• Setting structures so that officers know where to find support and assistance<br />
Before the union does any more campaigns we must look hard at how we go about them.<br />
• This has been promised year after year without change<br />
• Housing, mental and sexual health, alcohol and other issues are too important to be let down by poor publicity<br />
• Current campaigns rely on stale and lazy methods that lead to poor turnout and have little impact<br />
This must change.</p>
<p>We must<br />
• Invest time in research to find the best ways to make a difference<br />
• Make publicity a key component &#8211; not just an afterthought<br />
• Assist students who want to run campaigns themselves, meaning issues affecting students are tackled directly</p>
<p>As a Welfare Officer I will<br />
• Inform students how to overcome issues and show them what rights they have<br />
• Make clear what students shouldn&#8217;t have to put up with<br />
• Encourage student feedback so we know what is affecting the student body<br />
• Work with the Academic Officer to improve pastoral care given by supervisors</p>
<p>Talk to me, I will listen. Vote Lewis for Welfare Officer.</p>

            <img src="bob-hughes.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>Last year, I promised greater focus on mental health, more sexual health screening at the Health Centre and more innovative ways of getting information to you. I brought you a series of events on emotional wellbeing and progress towards better mitigating circumstances procedure for when things go wrong. I brought you extra GUM clinic sessions in the Health Centre. And I brought you new ideas, from the hugely successful Clubbers&#8217; Bus to get you home safely from a night out, to working with YSTV on York Come Dine With Me. But there is still a lot to be done.</p>
<p>This year will see massive changes to our University: the introduction of the 24-hour library, Langwith&#8217;s move to Heslington East, and the introduction of £9k fees. At this time of flux, it&#8217;s vital that we have a Welfare Officer who has already hit the ground running to ensure you get the support you need, from support services, late-night food-making facilities in the library and security to help you get home safely, to making sure that Heslington West, Fairfax and Halifax aren&#8217;t forgotten when it comes to investment in safety, security and lighting.</p>
<p>The quality of campus accommodation varies wildly; for students left with the last choice of where to live, it&#8217;s unfair that you are being given cramped kitchens, faulty facilities and a reporting structure that often leaves you waiting weeks for repairs. I have been vocal about this with the University, pushed for development of older accommodation, and organised consultation meetings where you can speak directly to the people who oversee your accommodation and have your views heard. I want to see this expand and become a regular part of how decisions affecting you are made: involving you.</p>
<p>With rising rents, we need a Welfare Officer who can hold landlords accountable to University standards, using the results of upcoming research to challenge bad practice across the board, and stop you getting messed around by letting you know your rights as tenants. I will bring in measures for properties to be checked so that you know that your landlord is providing you with the best accommodation they can and put information out early so that you are as well-informed about housing as possible well before you sign.</p>
<p>Pressure on students under the new fee regime will be greater than ever before- we need support services that meet demand, reflect need and are accessible at all levels. I will lobby for extra, more relevant training for supervisors, push for more support staff across the University, and work with departments so they understand the importance of mitigating circumstances- you shouldn&#8217;t be disadvantaged because of which degree you chose.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve proven that I can deliver results for you, and this year, I&#8217;m more passionate, experienced and energetic than ever. So please re-elect me, Bob Hughes, as your Welfare Officer.</p>

            <img src="helen-marrison.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>From a corset-wearing villain with Pantsoc in Central Hall, to broadcasting with URY, playing the trumpet with Concert Band and fighting it out in Doxbridge and Roses, my life at York has gone way beyond doing my degree &#8211; something I believe to be an essential part in making the most out of your time at university, and a passion for which encouraged me to become involved with YUSU as Student Development Assembly Chair, and run for Student Activities Officer.</p>
<p>So, what do I stand for? The five big policies:</p>
<p>1. Activities on Heslington East &#8211; Allowing societies, RAG and volunteering access to the new campus; be it using the rooms, or sessions with the equipment. With several departments, two colleges and the sports centre set for residence in 2012/13, I believe reaching out to be an achievable and understandable demand.</p>
<p>2. YUSU &#8216;Pot of Gold&#8217; &#8211; I want to make new fund available where Grant and Alumni applications have past or been unsuccessful so that every awesome, yet unexpected, idea can be made a reality. The increase in tuition fees should improve all aspects of the university, and the Union is no exception. This could work in cooperation with YorkSport.</p>
<p>3. The future &#8211; Working with York Alumni is an untapped resource for applying and communicating the advantages of being involved in student activities. I will work with the Alumni Office and Careers Service to tailor speakers and guests to engage with the kinds of activities we offer to give students a face-to-face link with future career paths.</p>
<p>4. Face time &#8211; I will have a dedicated weekly Student Surgery, where anyone &#8211; from societies, RAG, volunteering and beyond &#8211; can come along to suggest a great project, thrash out a problem or just have a chat.</p>
<p>5. The experience &#8211; RAG really makes a mark with campus events like Woodstock and the new Winter Wonderland, so let&#8217;s make them bigger and better! With more involvement from all areas of Activities. Bring more owls on campus! And maybe a couple of reindeer&#8230;</p>
<p>Alongside all that, I promise to keep student interests at heart by looking to make ratification, grant applications and handover simpler, push the use of campus bars, improving the reach and awareness of volunteering and continue to develop the strength and effectiveness of Societies Committee and the Student Development Assembly to make a more integrated and effective YUSU.</p>
<p>With these realistic and achievable goals, and more and more students coming to York next year I will put all my energy into encouraging, enabling and enhancing societies, RAG and volunteering. I believe my involvement in a variety of societies from a fresher to committee member, to my position as Student Development Chair has given me the dedication, insight and organisational skills to do this job to the full, and love every second of it.</p>
<p>Vote Marrison for Activities!</p>
<p>Thanks and love, Helen.</p>

            <img src="chris-west.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>My name is Chris West and I believe that you cannot have a true university experience unless you take advantage of what&#8217;s on outside the lecture hall. I know from my experience as treasurer of History Society and the Darts Society what a rewarding experience being involved in a society can offer. I want to run for this position to widen this experience, so everyone can benefit from what York has to offer.</p>
<p>I aim to achieve these goals with a few simple but effective policies &#8211; activities for all, supporting students for all and bigger and better RAG.</p>
<p>Activities for all</p>
<p>My key pledge is to ensure that by the next Freshers&#8217; Fair, every single Fresher is given a voucher to subsidise society membership up to £5.</p>
<p>I will also help develop sponsorship support by building up relations with local businesses, making it easier for societies and media outlets to get funds. This is crucial to the growth of societies, and I will take responsibility for spearheading the policy.</p>
<p>I will be clear to the university &#8211; postering must return. It is the lifeblood of societies and builds a community for students.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to see improved activities training with media training to help activities raise their profile through increased publicity. I will also set up weekly drop-in sessions where I set aside a designated time for anyone to come and ask questions.</p>
<p>Supporting Student Enterprise</p>
<p>In this tough climate, starting and running your own company can not only be a fantastic opportunity, but also make you stand out to potential employers. This is somewhere the union can offer real support, providing workshops to help people turn their ideas into realities and promoting company events</p>
<p>I also believe that student enterprise should be able to access Freshers&#8217; Fair free of charge, in order to showcase the opportunities there are in York for entrepreneurship as well as giving student companies access to all YUSU training.</p>
<p>Bigger and better RAG</p>
<p>I believe RAG can become bigger and better than the already strong position it is in. It needs to become more accessible, so that it is not just the committee and few select others who are running all RAG events.</p>
<p>The termly campus RAG events, such as RAG Week and Winter Wonderland need to be promoted more so they can reach the notoriety of Woodstock. To do this, I will promote links between societies, student media and RAG. I am also keen to ensure that RAG is included in all work done on increasing sponsorship.</p>
<p>I will ensure that RAG Charities have closer connections with RAG, allowing us to organise trips and speakers, so people know where their donations are being spent.</p>
<p>I hope these policies show my commitment to this role, and that I can provide a breath of fresh air into the student activities area. If you want to see these policies in action VOTE CHRIS WEST FOR STUDENT ACTIVITIES!</p>

            <img src="dong-oh-shin.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a final year Accounting student, running for York Sport President and I aim to bring my skills and abilities to York Sport, continuing the successes from Sam Asfahani. The last two years have seen huge progress within Sport at York. I promise to continue this achievement, adapting to new changes being implemented, most notably the Sports Village and the students fee increase.</p>
<p>I am a University and college hockey player, a qualified hockey umpire, and am already a YUSU employee, working at the Courtyard and also as part of the Doorsafe team. For the last two years I have been part of the Halifax College committee, and was a key member in setting up the Accounting &#038; Finance Society. With these credentials, I am certain I can bring a refreshed and excellent service to Sport at York.</p>
<p>Sports allow people to develop themselves and one of my main goals is to increase awareness of the sporting clubs and facilities available. Uniting diverse groups of university students will increase individual development, allow greater social activity, and strengthen the standard of York Sport. This will require close work with individual colleges and departments, and both sporting and non-sporting societies; raising significant awareness of what we can provide.</p>
<p>In addition, I aim to form an inter-college communication system and enhance this with a college-university system allowing members of university sports teams to easily communicate with their college counterparts to discuss new potential talent, and offer playing time to those who are missing out.</p>
<p>The New Sports Village will also be debuting in 2012, and I will be ensuring a smooth and seamless transformation. Foreseeing potential transportation and logistical issues will be part of this, especially when transporting kit and players from site to site. I will discuss with York Pullman Buses to investigate a more frequent inter-campus service on a Wednesday to provide greater flexibility to teams. Roses 2013 will also be the first to be played at York with our new Sports Village, and it will be a rewarding success to win and overcome any challenges.</p>
<p>With regards to transportation, I will draw up and issue all teams with clear travel guidelines when playing away. Too often teams have struggled to get to away matches on time or have been left waiting. I will also investigate the provisions of extra transport arrangements such as self-drive minibuses, leading to cost benefits and shorter travelling times.</p>
<p>Finally, the lease on the sports tent is only valid for four years, and one of my long term legacies will be to investigate the viable options of extending its life. I will also be providing the groundwork and investigating the possibility of modernising the life of the current facilities, particularly the athletics track. Whilst the new Sports Village is set to dominate, keeping our current facilities up to date showcases the excellence of York Sport and will draw in many key talents in the future.</p>
<p>So vote for Dong-Oh as your York Sport President.</p>

            <img src="charlotte-winter.jpg" alt="" title="" />                            <p>As the new facilities open on Heslington East, York Sport now has the opportunity to develop a culture of cooperation and unity between individuals, university teams and college sport. Focusing on performance, participation and communication I want to make York Sport the strongest it has ever been.</p>
<p>Performance- It is essential that our students optimise their personal potential through these facilities. The new sports center, a clear equal of David Lloyd has the tools to allow the advancement of individuals in an array of sports. I want to ensure that our students are being given the best opportunities to harness their talents and excel.</p>
<p>Participation- Both university sport and college sport has to be driven from fresher&#8217;s week. In particular I want to improve the infrastructure of college sport, extending some leagues as well as looking at other sports which could be introduced. I also want to continue to establish links between college sports and their university equivalents, looking at creating more barbarian teams as this is beneficial both for university teams who can look for potential new talent and for college teams who can gain experience and coaching.</p>
<p>Communication- I propose the introduction of a termly meeting with Presidents of clubs with the York Sport Committee as well as creating a group which includes all of these members to ensure that clubs feel fully aware of the changes and happenings within York Sport. Moreover, closer cooperation between club presidents will help to foster a sense of unity between clubs enable the clubs to share ideas, such as the best methods to promote or fundraiser for their club. I feel it will also generate a greater level of support between clubs, we need more people coming down to 22 acres and the sports tent to support our teams. York shouldn&#8217;t be about individual teams it should be one team.</p>
<p>Having competed both at college and university level sport since my first year, and being College Sport Officer and a member of the York Sport Committee, I have a thorough understanding of how sport is administered and perceived at York. Moreover, through these experiences I have developed a passion for not only sport, but York Sport wanting to make it the best it can be.</p>
