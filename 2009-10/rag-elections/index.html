  <h2 class="eurotitle">RAG Elections</h2>
<div>
<p>
This term will see RAG host its annual elections In order to decide which charities succeed Martin House Childrens Hospice, York LINKS, York Spinal Injuries Association, Help for Heroes and Medicine Sans Frontiers in joining our Permenant Beneficiary Student Action as an elected charity of the 09/10 academic year.
</p>
<p>
Due to the introduction of ultra vires fundraising on campus, meaning societies and sports clubs can only fundraise for external charities through RAG, it was decided that only student and society nominated charities would be entered into the elections, and there has been a record number of charities nominated by students â€“ allowing them to take ownership of the elections.
</p>
<p>
There are three categories for the elections, local, national and international. The top two local charities, the top international charity and the top national charity will be joined as next years beneficiaries by the charity which polls the most votes but does not top a category.
</p>
<p>
The following charities have been nominated for each section:
